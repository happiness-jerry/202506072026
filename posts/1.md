**Material Type**: Short Story  
**Content**:  
It was Saturday morning, and Jake woke up feeling groggy. “I **could do with** a strong cup of coffee,” he muttered, heading to the kitchen—only to find he was out of beans. He sighed and decided to **make do (with)** some instant coffee he found at the back of the cupboard.
His phone buzzed. It was his friend inviting him on a last-minute hiking trip. “Well, **if need be**, I can pack up and go,” Jake thought. But honestly, he didn’t **feel like** hiking today. He just wanted to lounge on the couch and binge-watch his favorite series.
Still, he **was dying to** try out his new camera, which he had bought just for outdoor photography. In fact, he had **set his heart on** capturing a perfect sunrise shot from the hilltop.
Jake glanced at the fridge. No snacks, no packed lunch—he'd have to **do without** his usual picnic setup. “Whatever,” he shrugged, “I’ll survive.”
His sister rolled her eyes when she saw him leaving in mismatched socks and a torn backpack. “Aren’t you going to change?” she asked.
Jake grinned, “I **couldn’t care less** what I look like right now.”
At the store on the way, he realized he couldn’t afford everything he wanted, so he had to **pick and choose** a few essentials: water, trail mix, and, of course, batteries for his camera.
